# Scientific-Calculator

Technologies Required - Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, and OOPS

Project Description:

A Scientific calculator built using Java is a general-purpose application whose primary objective is to perform basic mathematical operations and also perform some essential and tricky solutions to trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc.

Core Features  :

All calculators should have the following features:                        

A state, representing the value currently displayed on the calculator (default null)                         
Get the current number on the display                         
Clear the display or you can delete the digits one by one                                      
Change the number on the display                                
Add, subtract, multiply, and divide the value on the display by a given number                                     
Calculate the square (x2) and square root (√x) of the number on the display                                   
Calculate the cube (x3) and x to the power 4 (x4) of the number on the display                         
Calculate the logarithms of the number on the display                          
Calculate the trigonometric functions and hyperbolic trigonometric functions of the number on the display                                 
Calculate the inverse of the number on the display (1/x)                         
Invert the sign of the number on the display (switch between positive and negative)
a state, representating the current on or off condition of calculator

Hints  :

The following functions should take the displayed value (x) and updated it according to the given formula: (this may not be an exhaustive list)

square(): x2                                                 
squareRoot(): √x                                
inverse(): 1/x                                     
switchSign(): -x                                    
sine(): sin(x)                                        
cosine(): cos(x)                                                    
tangent(): tan(x)                                    
hyperbolicSine(): sinh(x)                                          
hyperbolicCosine(): cosh(x)                                         
hyperbolicTangent(): tanh(x)                                             
factorial(): x! (x factorial)
